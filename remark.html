# Red-black Tree Properties

<i>When discussing Red-Black Trees, the NULL nodes which terminate the tree are considered to be the leaves and are coloured black.</i>

--

count: false

1. All nodes are either red or black.
2. The root and all leaves are black.
3. All red nodes must have black children nodes.
4. All paths from a node to a leaf contain the same number of black nodes. <i>Also called the black height</i>

# Inserting into a Red-Black Tree

The overall strategy of inserting into a Red-Black tree is to
1. Insert the node just like a normal BST. All new nodes start out as red.
2. If any of the four principles of the Red-Black Tree are broken, correct them by recoloring and rotating certain nodes.

---

# Possible scenarios
After inserting our new Red node into our Red-Black Tree (just like we would a normal BST), one of three scenarios could happen.

1. New node is the root.
2. New node has a red uncle.
3. New node has a black uncle.

---

# Defining our node

```python
class RBNode(Node):
  RED = True
  BLACK = False

  def __init__(self, number):
    self.left = None
    self.right = None
    self.parent = None
    self.color = self.RED
    self.set_number(number)

  def set_number(self, number):
      self.number = number
      self.fix_value()

  def set_color(self, color):
      self.color = color
      self.fix_value()

  def fix_value(self):
      if self.color == self.RED:
          appendString = 'R'
      else:
          appendString = 'B'

      self.value = str(self.number) + appendString
```
---

```python
class RBNode(Node):
  # ... Other Methods ...

  def right_rotate(self):
      ...

  def left_rotate(self):
      ...

  def is_right_node(self):
      ...

  def is_left_node(self):
      ...

  def uncle(self):
      p = self.parent

      if p is None: return None

      g = self.parent.parent

      if g is None: return None

      if p.is_left_node(): u = g.right
      else: u = g.left
      return u

  def toggle_color(self):
      self.set_color(not self.color)
      self.fix_value()
```
---
```python
class RedBlackTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def add(self, value):
        new_node = RBNode(value)

        if self.root == None:
            self.root = new_node
            self.fix_violations(new_node)
            return

        self.root.add(new_node)
        if new_node.parent.color == RBNode.RED:
            self.fix_violations(new_node)

    def right_rotate(self, node):
        new_root = node.right_rotate()
        if node == self.root:
            self.root = new_root

    def left_rotate(self, node):
        new_root = node.left_rotate()
        if node == self.root:
            self.root = new_root

    def fix_violations(self, violating_node):
        # Magic goes here
```
---
```python
def fix_violations(self, violating_node):
    print("Attempting to fix " + str(violating_node))
    if violating_node == self.root:
        print(str(violating_node) + " is the root. Setting to black.")
        violating_node.set_color(RBNode.BLACK)
        return

    uncle = violating_node.uncle()
    parent = violating_node.parent
    if parent is None: return
    grandparent = parent.parent

# Any Questions?
##### <i>Cause we're about to move onto Graphs :)</i>

# What is a Graph?

* A graph is a <strong>set</strong> of nodes and a <strong>set</strong> of edges.

![image](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/files/graph-data-structures-L.gif)

* A mathematical model used in Graph Theory.

# Why Graphs?

Graphs represent certain sets of data in the most elegant of ways.

* Social Networks
* Networks
* Anything where everything could potentially connect to everything...

---

# Graph Databases

There are an entire class of databases that revolve around Graphs.

Facebook API uses something called GraphQL.

---

# Edges & Arcs

* Edges can be represented as ordered pairs or unordered pairs.
* (A, B) is an example of an ordered pair. These are called Arcs.
* {A, B} is an example of an unordered pair and can also be represented like {B, A}. These are called edges.

---

# Different types of Graphs

* Directed Graph - A graph that is represented through nodes + arcs.
* Undirected Graph - A graph that is represented through nodes + edges.

---

# Directed Graph

# Undirected Graph

# Does facebook use a directed graph or undirected graph? What about Twitter?

---

# Weighted vs Unweighted

* A weighted graph is a graph where the arcs or edges have values to represent the "difficulty" of traversing them.
* An unweignted graph is a graph where the weight of all arcs and edges are equal or nonexistant.

# Weighted Graph

# Unweighted Graph

---

# Creating our own graph.

```python
class GraphNode:
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
    self.neighbors = []
```

```python
class MyGraph:
  def __init__(self):
    self.entry = None
```
